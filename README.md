When I see large numbers (like 15000000) in small text, it's hard to read. Is
that 15 million, 1.5 million, 150 million? This is why we use commas to
seperate the digits. This workflow adds thousands seperators to numbers. 

To use, select a number with your cursor in any app and use the workflow's
hotkey (by default, Apple-.) to show the number in large print with thousands
seperator.
